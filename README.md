# HAW PR Lab 2

These are possible solutions to the PSET of lab 2.

I divided them into four separate versions:

1. Simple
1. Intermediate
1. Advanced
1. Insane (Open at your own risk)

## Version explanation

Each version has a different level of complexitiy. Some elements are not included in all versions.

First of all, I'm proud of you!!!
Admitting that you're stupid is a big step.

The simplified version is barebones and only "works".
