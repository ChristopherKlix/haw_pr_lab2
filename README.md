# HAW PR Lab 2

These are possible solutions to the PSET of lab 2.

I divided them into four separate versions:

1. Simple
1. Intermediate
1. Advanced
1. Insane (Open at your own risk)

## Version explanation

Each version has a different level of complexitiy. Some elements are not included in all versions.
